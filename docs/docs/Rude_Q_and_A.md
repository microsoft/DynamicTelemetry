This section addresses commonly asked questions that are challenging or difficult. It is called "Rude Q and A" because it encourages asking tough, awkward, or uncomfortable questions.

Please be polite when asking questions here, but do not feel the need to create a false sense of harmony. This page is for addressing difficult problems directly.

## Deployment;  too fast = accelerated problems,  too slow = decelerated solution
The rate of deployment is a double-edged sword. On one hand, deploying quickly can help scale solutions, such as scrubbing a security credential. On the other hand, if your attempt to diagnose or scrub itself has an error, you can end up increasing risks to a user.

This section of Rude Q and A covers deployments in this dilemma.


### Q1: Don't deployments carry risks?
Deployments carry risks; code or configuration - doesn't Dynamic Telemetry encourage accelerated deployments, and won't that carry risks?

#### A1: Yes, there are risks; but there is also a taxonomy for understanding
The [Observer Effect](./PositionPaper.ObserverEffect.document.md) document covers this topic at a high level. It's important to know that 100% of all Probes, Actions, and Processors in Dynamic Telemetry are intentionally read-only. This is not to say that Dynamic Telemetry's implementation is bug-free. However, by design and intent, no part of Dynamic Telemetry should alter your system state.

An interesting discussion should be started about where the line is and if it can be enforced technically, or if it's strictly a business problem that can be solved through policy and taxonomy. As a thought experiment, consider a database that has update policies that are run on ingestion and used for versioning. Most reasonable people can agree that this is a useful feature of a database and is something that an administrator can apply nearly instantaneously. To reject the ability for Dynamic Telemetry to have dynamic deployments is akin to rejecting this capability. The question only seems to be where the balance is and how to map that balance into the business needs.

Unfortunately, are cases where risks are present. For example, CPU sampling can impact performance, memory dumps will pause your threads, and extracting memory can pose security risks.

Dynamic Telemetry offers [a taxonomy of risk measurement](./PositionPaper.ProbeRiskLevels.document.md) used in actions and probes. This taxonomy clearly communicates the risks to business decision-makers, allowing them to choose which probes and actions are permissible in their environment and under what deployment constraints.



## Security

A serious concern in Dynamic Telemetry is that an adversary who gains the ability to deploy dynamic probes into a memory space potentially has the ability to extract sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, and credentials. Another attack vector could be enabling a row of logging that had been previously suppressed or set at a lower capture level.

This section covers those topics.

### Q2: Can memory extraction probes be used by an adversary to extract memory and compromise security?

#### A2: Potentially. Care must be taken.
A memory extraction probe is one of the more flexible and useful tools in Dynamic Telemetry. Built upon technologies such as DTrace, Ptrace, Uprobes, and Kprobes, it allows for detailed memory analysis. However, if an adversary compromises the deployment of Dynamic Telemetry configuration, they may be able to extract memory, potentially leading to a system compromise.

This is similar to being in control of any form of system deployment or CI/CD pipeline.

An attacker would also need access to the backend databases to harvest the extracted memory.

Use of a memory extraction probe should be done in a contained environment, using secure workstations, and following extra processes and procedures that likely include audits.


## Potentially Confused Topics

The section below focuses less on security, privacy, or logistical deployment risks and more on the architecture and potential conflicts in design. For example, it appears contradictory to state that Dynamic Telemetry does not have rigid schemas while simultaneously offering capabilities built upon rigid schemas.

### Q3 : Dynamic Telemetry takes a position of no rigid schemas - isnt this at odds with the value prop of Design Patterns?

[reading material](./PositionPaper.SharingDataAmongStakeHoldersIsHard.document.md)

#### A3 : Maybe.. it's something we should discuss
A keen reader of the Dynamic Telemetry documentation will notice potential incongruity found in the design pattern documentation. Specifically, the design patterns discussed have rigid schemas as their core value proposition. This is potentially something that should be further discussed if the design patterns are included in Dynamic Telemetry or built atop it.``
