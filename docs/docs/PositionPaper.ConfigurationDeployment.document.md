# Configuration Deployment

## Mechanisms

1. All [PROBE's](./Definitions.document.md#PROBE) must be intentionally read-only

1. Configuration Code Review;  two trained employees verify the [PROBE](./Definitions.document.md#PROBE) will not collect unapproved information.

1. Ringed Deployment; instead of deploying to all machines, intantly, deploymens can be deployed slowly

1. 'Rip Cords'; near instant disablement in the case of emergency
