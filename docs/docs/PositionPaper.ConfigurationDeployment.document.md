# The Stresses and Risks behind simple 'Configuration' Deployment

## Mechanisms

1. All [PROBE's](./Definitions.document.md) must be intentionally
   read-only

1. Configuration Code Review; two trained employees verify the
   [PROBE](./Definitions.document.md) will not collect unapproved
   information.

1. Ringed Deployment; instead of deploying to all machines, intantly, deploymens
   can be deployed slowly

1. 'Rip Cords'; near instant disablement in the case of emergency
