# Short Horizon Flight Recorder

![](../orig_media/ShortHorizon.banner.png)

A Short Horizon Flight Recorder is a focused Flight Recorder, designed to
capture and store a higher volume of logging than is responsible to always
stream via OpenTelemetry. A Short Horizon Flight Recorder employs broad and
loosely filtered logs to collect as much logging as possible For several minutes
before allowing its collection buffers to wrap.

By capturing high-volume telemetry right before events like crashes or lockups,
the Short Horizon recorder streamlines failure analysis. It empowers engineering
teams to isolate race conditions, examine deadlocks, or retrieve critical logs
without excessive overhead or wasted storage. This targeted method contrasts
with "Long Horizons" which rely on more extended data retention (with less
telemetry volume), for root cause analysis.

Adopting a Short Horizon approach offers operational benefits and an extra layer
of confidence.

A well-implemented Short Horizon Flight Recorder can be thought of as a vault or
an airplane's Flight Recorder, capturing all problems regardless of the
situation.

When used this way, the Short Horizon Flight Recorder becomes the developer's
best friend as well as a communication tool for project managers.

Expectations can be set with development, test, and operations teams so that
anytime a problem occurs, it is always expected that this short horizon flight
record will be collected.

In some circles, this is conventionally known as pressing ***THE BIG RED
BUTTON***. When a problem manifests, the culture expects that "something"
pressed the BigRed button.

This consistency is a place of investment, anytime a problem manifests, no
matter which team is involved, the expectation is that someone (or more likely
an Action) pressed this 'button'

By ensuring that every incident is logged and analyzed with the content of a
Long Horizon Flight Recorder, your teams will build trust and develop custom
diagnostic processors around the Flight Recorder. he Short Horizon Flight
Recorder fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. Teams
can review logs to understand what went wrong, learn from mistakes, and
implement better practices.

This iterative process enhances overall software
quality and when used well, will encourage cost reduction, privacy improvements,
and security hardening.

**This is because a log that is not emitted is the most cost-effective, private,
and secure log.**

## Criteria (and differentiators from 'Long Horizons')

While the exact memory budget and sampling criteria for a Short Horizon Flight
Recorder can vary, there are some established guidelines that have proven
effective over time. These criteria help ensure that the recorder captures
useful data without overwhelming system resources. Key considerations include:

- **Fixed memory budget**: Typically, a predefined limit such as 32MB is set to
  ensure that the recorder does not consume excessive memory.
- **Broad collection scope**: The recorder should capture a wide range of events,
  but focus on a narrow set of critical events to avoid unnecessary data.
- **Performance impact**: The recorder may affect system performance, so it is often
  used in conjunction with filters to manage the volume of collected data.

These guidelines help create an efficient and effective Short Horizon Flight
Recorder that balances comprehensive data collection with system performance and
resource constraints.

## Sample Applications

There are numerous applications for a Short Horizon Flight Recorder. Here are a
few personal favorites of the author:

1. Excellent for creating management processes around diagnosing failures and
   standardizing diagnostic procedures.
1. Useful for zooming into problematic areas to catch bugs with a 'net'
   [as detailed here](./PositionPaper.ProceduralizeNets.document.md).
1. Ideal for high-volume logging when verbosity is needed prior to an event,
   such as a crash.
1. Effective for identifying race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency
   issues.
1. Provides emotional relief for engineers by offering a reliable tool during
   cost-saving initiatives.
