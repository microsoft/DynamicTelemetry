Dynamic telemetry can be technically intimidating and challenging. This Scenario Driven section, aims to offer a usage vantage into this complex subject.

This Scenario section will cover various scenarios commonly used by different
personas to achieve business or technical results.We will discuss
several key scenario groupings in future sections, starting with the
essential ones.

1.  Reducing costs while selectively enabling or disabling telemetry
    dynamically without deployments.

2.  Analyzing and evaluating the performance characteristics of software
    components, including edge cases.

3.  Enhancements in security and privacy by swiftly detecting and
    redacting log telemetry or fields that may unintentionally contain
    sensitive information.

4.  Deep diagnostics of software issues, including debugging and
    performance failures.

5.  Improving software reliability through clear failure schemas,
    problem detection, and AB feature selection.

6.  Creating, maintaining, and extending durable dashboards and alerts
    using telemetry to ensure architectural flexibility as database and
    reporting technologies evolve.

7.  Adapting to and migrating hosting environments -- perhaps by
    converting large macro services into microservices or aggregating
    microservices and libraries
