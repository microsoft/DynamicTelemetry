# Overview of Dynamic Telemetry Scenarios

Dynamic Telemetry can be technically intimidating and challenging. This Scenario
Driven section, aims to offer a usage vantage into this complex subject.

This Scenario section will cover various scenarios commonly used by different
personas to achieve business or technical results.We will discuss several key
scenario groupings in future sections, starting with the essential ones.

1. Reducing costs while selectively enabling or disabling telemetry dynamically
   without deployments.

1. Analyzing and evaluating the performance characteristics of software
   components, including edge cases.

1. Enhancements in security and privacy by swiftly detecting and redacting log
   telemetry or fields that may unintentionally contain sensitive information.

1. Deep diagnostics of software issues, including debugging and performance
   failures.

1. Improving software reliability through clear failure schemas, problem
   detection, and AB feature selection.

1. Creating, maintaining, and extending durable dashboards and alerts using
   telemetry to ensure architectural flexibility as database and reporting
   technologies evolve.

1. Adapting to and migrating hosting environments -- perhaps by converting large
   macro services into microservices or aggregating microservices and libraries
