# Offbox Processor Coming Soon

![](../orig_media/Architecture.Boxes.Yes.DynamicTelemetry.drawio.png)

This processor has a unique characteristic of being off-box and separate from the machine being monitored. This is likely the least risky location to start the migration of dynamic telemetry. It acts as a filter or data shaper. Because it simply morphs telemetry after being produced, the machine producing it is unaware of its presence.

For example, this is a good location for initial security or privacy scrubbing. Tokens would be emitted from the machine but dropped prior to being ingested into a database.
