If there is any aspect of dynamic telemetry that requires thorough
understanding, it is the critical distinction between static telemetry
and dynamic telemetry. At its core, this distinction represents the
transition from hard-coded, static assets to more versatile and
utilitarian dynamic telemetry. This concept forms the foundation of
dynamic telemetry.

There are two crucial classifications of enhancements applied to
telemetry: traditional telemetry markers. These classifications are: (1)
the **action**, and (2) the **probe**.

A deeper discussion will be presented in subsequent subsections.
Generally, a probe refers to an element that can be added to software,
emitting information that can be dynamically used and modeled during
runtime in ways unanticipated by the original programmer.

The second concept involves actions---when a probe identifies something
of interest, a state machine can be dynamically deployed and attached to
the running system without compromising its security and privacy. An
action involves collecting information that was not previously gathered
before the implementation of dynamic telemetry.
