# Reliability and Testing

![image](../orig_media/Reliability.banner.png)

After you apply some thinking into probing an action aspects of dynamic
telemetry you may come to realize that using these facilities provide an
interesting technique into the testing and hardening your
[Production](./PositionPaper.DefiningProduction.document.md) systems.

Traditional testing requires decoupling of the software from into smaller pieces
each of which are tested independently, often adding unit tests to orchestrate.
Is this complexity of the software grows unit tests remain useful but often
struggle to detect integration type failures.

To cope with this many developers will start using scenario testing which blends
together different architectural components into one logical set which is then
tested as a entire scenario. Should the scenario fail the developer will start
zooming in on the area that failed and from there they will look into the
logging of the subsystem looking for root cause.

The systems aren't bad, but a problem emerges as the complexity of this system
grows, especially when multiple machines participate in one of the scenarios. As
the complexity grows many developers simply get frustrated and in some ways give
up.

Dynamic Telemetry introduces an interesting set of capabilities that result in a
interesting hybrid between scenario and unit tests.

The idea is to to use the logging and metrics found within a piece of software
to self describe desired and expected behavior such that the product itself
could detect its own failures.

[Processors](./Architecture.Components.Processor.Overview.document.md) are then
configured to "look" for problems, that emanate from the very core of the
software executing.

In itself this is not a novel or new concept in fact entire books have been
written on the subject.

What is interesting, and potentially is novel, is the idea of using a combination
of one box [in
process](./Architecture.Components.Observer.InProcess.document.md)/[on
box](./Architecture.Components.Observer.External.OnBox.document.md) and [off
box](./Architecture.Components.Observer.External.OnBox.document.md) observers to
this lightly schematized telemetry to look for patterns and failures that
wouldn't be necessarily caught within a unit test or scenario test.

This is especially true as a systems complexity grows into stress testing or
penetration testing where network fuzzing or payload fuzzing has been enabled.

The remainder of this section will discuss a few different ways of thinking about
testing such that your code self describes, and detects problems - and
automatically generates verbose diagnostics for you, to help you fix the
problem.

## Introducing Your Tools : [Processors](./Architecture.Components.Processor.Overview.document.md), [Probes](./Architecture.Probes.Overview.document.md), [Actions](./Architecture.Action.Explanation.document.md), [Filters, Routers](./Architecture.Components.FiltersRoutersAndAdapters.document.md) and [Flight Recorders](./Architecture.FlightRecorder.Overview.document.md)

Imagine your software has the ability to self-described failure.
Perhaps when you author a enqueue() operation you also supply nominal
expectations (for example, that no item sticks in the queue more than 200 ms).

Should the completion take longer than 200 milliseconds this would indicate a
warning, that perhaps not fatal, might indicate the need for a programmer to
inspect and figure out why.

The Processor portion of Dynamic Telemetry permit a developer to craft little
traps for their bugs;  you cna easily imagine using a [loose
schema](PositionPaper.ClearFailuresViaSchema.document.md) that describes certain
logs and what good and bad looks like!

This concept of self describing operational state is extremely interesting when
a when coupled with dynamic configuration in the telemetry system, because
opportunity is created for these values to be trained into the system instead of
programmed in. It's not tough to see applications in AI.

These concepts will be expanded in further sections but they're worth thought.

## Understanding By Example : Surveying Interesting Testing Techniques

### Entropy Creators

As you explore using telemetry to pass and fail tests, and consider different
layers of testing as your code's execution environment changes, it becomes clear
how crucial unit testing, stress testing, and scenario testing are. This method
offers a powerful solution to many complex software issues by defining the
characteristics you want to verify through tests that are dynamically attached
to the software as external observers.

Once these tests are attached as observers, they can be monitored from various
points. At this stage, the test engineer needs to design tests that introduce
enough entropy into the system to determine if the test passes or fails. This
testing approach is quite fascinating and aligns with some philosophical
principles in unit testing, deserving further consideration.

### Appropriate Alerts

This innovative approach ensures that every aspect of the software is
continuously monitored, providing real-time insights and enabling proactive
responses to potential issues. With Dynamic Telemetry, developers can achieve
unparalleled levels of observability, making it easier than ever to maintain the
reliability and performance of their systems. Embrace the future of testing with
Dynamic Telemetry and experience the power of comprehensive, real-time system
monitoring.

Dynamic Telemetry addresses these challenges by integrating testing into the
production code and leveraging both internal and external observations. This
approach bridges the gap between multiple disciplines, allowing for singular
functionality runs that encompass various testing methods. By doing so, Dynamic
Telemetry provides a unified and efficient testing framework that enhances
system reliability and performance.

### Traditional "Testing" - Telemetry, Analysis, and Informing

Traditional testing often involves a series of predefined tests that are run in
a controlled environment to ensure that the software behaves as expected. One
crucial aspect of this process is emitting signals. Often these signals are the
comfortable primitives taught in school - error codes, crashs, or thrown
exceptions.

By emitting these signals during testing, developers can monitor the system's
performance and identify any anomalies or failures.

Once the signals are emitted, the next step is studying the results. This
involves analyzing the collected data to understand the system's behavior and
identify any potential issues. The developer will use the simplified failures
(error codes, crashes, or thrown exceptions) as indication that the software is
not performing to specification, and will then open up log files and source code
to figure out what happened.

Finally, it's essential to inform the operator about the test results. This can
be done through alerts or dashboards that provide real-time updates on the
system's status. If a test case fails or a dashboard alert goes off, the
operator can quickly take action to address the issue. This proactive approach
helps prevent potential problems from escalating and ensures that the system
remains stable and reliable. By incorporating these steps into the test
pipeline, organizations can achieve a higher level of observability and maintain
the quality of their software.

With Dynamic Telemetry, your test assets are broken into five themes

## Testing Themes

### Specialized Environmental Testing

After careful consideration of using the telemetry system as a means of inner
processor remote communication, it becomes evident that such a system can signal
an external test when a failure occurs. This realization allows developers to
write code that is easy to diagnose. The code itself aims to assist in detecting
bugs, and the operational environment, through Dynamic Telemetry, supports both
the programmer and the program in this endeavor.

We will introduce two key concepts that are elaborated upon further in the
documentation and are essential for comprehensive understanding. These concepts
are probes and actions. A probe, in its simplest form, is nothing more than a
log or metric emitted by a piece of code, for example, when a file is opened.
The log may include the file name and the return code from the open system call.

An action is part of a dynamically deployed processor that monitors the
operational characteristics of the system either internally within the process,
externally on the same computer, or even remotely from a backend. The action
listens to logging and metrics as they are generated. When a particular log or
metric with a specific failure code of interest is emitted, the action can
trigger rich diagnostic collections, which may include a memory dump, a CPU
sample, or could enable the collection of more verbose logs.

At this point, you may be considering innovative ways to utilize these
capabilities. For instance, you could establish a queue with an external
observer that initiates a failure indicator if the queue becomes completely
empty or exceeds a predetermined limit. You might be wondering what this preset
number should be. It is important to note that Dynamic Telemetry does not
specify these details; instead, it provides the fundamental constructs necessary
to build such objects.

One could envision a queue object where, upon initialization, diagnostic
configurations are provided by the developer that include the minimum and
maximum expected lengths of the queue. Perhaps this queue contains an expected
flow rate. You can quickly imagine how an internal external observer could
initiate diagnostic collections should any of these parameters we operating
outside of specification.

Experienced programmers may understandably become concerned about the accuracy
of hardcoded values. Consider a scenario where a queue is designed for specific
hardware, but over time, as hardware evolves and becomes faster, the queue links
could either expand or contract accordingly. Additionally, queue depths might
fluctuate based on varying usage patterns throughout the day across different
regions.

The apprehension of such programmers is justified. However, the concept of
Dynamic Telemetry addresses these concerns by allowing programmers to specify
nominal values during the initial setup on the expected hardware. In cases where
these initial guesses are incorrect, dynamic telemetry supports a training
process that measures and adjusts these values based on the new hardware or
environment being utilized.

...in short, the hardcoded values are reasonable guesses; the real values will
be specified during operational training, on real hardware, with real workloads.

... if this is interesting, now imagine you have different environments where
the same code is executing, each having different configurations for failure
attached - for instance, in a unit testing environment, one set of
configurations is applied. In contrast, a different configuration set is used
for scenario testing, and yet another set for stress or fuzz testing.

Later in this section, we will further elaborate and provide detailed examples.

### Authoring Self-Describing Production Code

Dynamic Telemetry takes advantage of the durable identifiers and structure
payloads within your logging in order to provide loose schemas that can be used
in self-describing quality characteristics of code. While these topics are
discussed further in other sections, the key aspect can be summarized as
Lightweight telemetry that signals positive failure, or can otherwise indicate
operational characteristics

### Auditing Code, in Production

* *Internal Audits*

    An internal audit production code involves creating classifications of
    errors that adhere to strict definitions, unlike the flexible
    classifications often found in other logging and telemetry systems.
    Specifically, this means that an error must clearly describe something
    exceptional that is not permitted. Every identified error requires
    investigation until resolved.

    For instance, the failure to open a key database file is an example of an
    error worth investigating, whereas the failure to open a user file may
    not be considered a failure. The distinction may seem subtle but is
    significant. For example, in a library that processes files, treating the
    failure to open a file as an error might be inappropriate. This type of
    failure might be flagged as a warning, whereas higher layers might treat
    it as a critical error, such as with a database.

* *External Audits*

   An external audit of the code introduces environmental characteristics to the
   code. For example, what might be a programmatic warning internal to the code
   could be treated as an error by an external observer.

   This is where the power of Dynamic Telemetry can be found. This power allows
   for the training of nominal operating characteristics for a particular
   environment on specific hardware. The external observer should be viewed as
   an advocate for the user within the operational environment.

   Imagine code in a unit test environment treating particular failures with
   extreme strictness; perhaps any file error is treated as an error worth
   investigating. However, as the code migrates from unit testing to scenario
   testing, the threshold for an investigated failure may shift.

   As the code enters the stress environment, the opposite characteristics may
   be applied. For instance, the inability to open a file may no longer be
   treated as an error but rather as a success.

   In all cases, however, failures encountered during fuzz testing are
   consistently regarded as errors worthy of further study.

   The ability to redefine what is a error worth investigating at runtime
   without recompilation is a key value of Dynamic Telemetry.

### Failure Induced Triggering of Verbose Diagnostics

Diagnostic collection essentially involves gathering the content that
programmers or operational teams deem necessary for diagnosing system failures.
Dynamic Telemetry defines an error as an issue requiring investigation,
therefore providing clear guidance, and total clarity of expectation, on the
subsequent steps and specifying what needs to be collected.

1. Should an internal external test fail
1. 'Detect' this in any one of your [Processor Locations](./Architecture.Components.Processor.Overview.document.md)
1. 'Trigger' a Diagnostic Collecting, containing what the developer said they
   need

It cannot get simpler. Best of all, with Dynamic Telemetry, the cost of mistakes
is low. Clear expectations do not guarantee unique logs, memory dumps, or CPU
traces when issues arise. Different personas, such as the operational team or
program management team, also set equally clear expectations.

These balances are explored more deeply in the diagnostic collection sections.
In short though; simply because a developer clearly requests a memory dump for
minor issues or seek extensive CPU sampling, they may not get what they want --
because their operational team set equally clear guidance on topics like memory,
disk, and CPU usage.
