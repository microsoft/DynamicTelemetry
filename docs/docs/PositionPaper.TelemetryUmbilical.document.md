# Telemetry UMBILICAL : INCOMPLETE

## Talking Points

```
1. Two Types of Telemetry [{file, streaming}](./PositionPaper.FileAndStreaming.document.md)
1. All telemetry for a partition {container, VM, or Host} must only use 2x sockets - multiple apps need to be aggregated / multiplexed
1. The 'umbilical' is a choke point; that has standard 'pipe fittings'
1. The umbilical can be 'cut' and rerouted - such that there are only two locations per 'partition' {container, VM, Host} to be cut, should (re)routing, filtering, need to occur
```
