# PROCESSOR : State Machine

The state machine processor is a relatively simple yet highly effective
component within dynamic telemetry. Essentially, this processor listens
to all log messages that pass by, identifying significant events and
managing a state machine based on those events. When the state machine
processor detects an interesting log message, it transitions to a new
state, potentially initiating an action as part of this transition.

## Introduction to State Machine Processor

The State Machine processor operates as a Directed Graph, where
transitions occur upon the observation of specific logs by the
Processor. This state machine is employed for tasks such as timing,
counting, and measuring in contexts that pose significant challenges.
The state machine is often accompanied by various actions and is
utilized to initiate complex or resource-intensive operations.

Its primary function is to monitor logs and transition between states
based on the analysis of log names and parameters. Initially, the state
machine starts in an undefined state and then dynamically adjusts its
state in response to the events it processes. This method is
particularly effective for tasks such as timing, counting, and measuring
in difficult contexts.

To provide an example, consider generating unique hashes of a file, such
as data files or JPEG images.

## Simple Code Example; hashing files

```cdocs_include
{{ CSharp_Include("../LookoutTower/Samples/FileExtensionStats/Sample.FileExtensionStats.cs",
    "//start-ImageHashExample",
    "//end-ImageHashExample")
}}
```

## Sample Code Overview

In this example you'll notice that the example code

1.  Logs when we begin hashing
2.  Hashs the file; or otherwise perform business logic
3.  Logs when we've completed the hashing of the file

This workflow outlines a typical sequence of operations for a developer.
Log messages may be disabled before entering production, used during
diagnostics, or employed to indicate failure and success in traditional
testing.

## Modeling Live System Behavior, with a State Machine Processor

Consider the state model processor as a tool to quickly and safely
understand the system\'s operational characteristics after deployment.

The state machine processor is typically beneficial in scenarios where
software has been deployed into a production environment, and it cannot
be rapidly altered or redeployed. It should be viewed as a diagnostic
tool that can be employed extensively without affecting user security,
privacy, or performance.

After a conclusion is reached by the state machine processor, the
production code is frequently modified to implement a more suitable and
permanent solution. Consequently, the state machine processor can be
deactivated once the revised deployment is completed.

Lets look at a few examples, as they likely will help tell the tale

Image a piece of code that looks something like this:

``` mermaid
    flowchart TD
        Unknown((Unknown))
        HashingFile((HashingFile))
        Unknown --> | LogStartingFileHash | HashingFile
        HashingFile--> |LogEndFileHash | Unknown
```
