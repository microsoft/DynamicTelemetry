# (COMING SOON) FILE vs. STREAMING Telemetry

## Introduction

DynamicTelemetry defines two types of telemetry - STREAMING, and FILE_BASED.

* STREAMING : typical Observability - intended for immediate egress, flowing into backend databases.
* FILE_BASED : telemetry that doesn't stream well, memory dumps, CPU samples, packet captures, or  FLIGHT_RECORDERS - only transmitted upon a failure

## STREAMING Telemetry

OpenTelemetry is the recommended Observability API surface for DynamicTelemetry. The essence of STREAMING telemetry is to capture observations/logs and upload them to a network-connected backend as soon as possible.

STREAMING telemetry has three common subtypes: Logs, Metrics, and Traces. These subtypes share the common goal of egressing the telemetry data as quickly as possible.

A key differentiator between STREAMING telemetry and FILE_BASED telemetry is that STREAMING telemetry is always emitted, whereas FILE_BASED telemetry is only transmitted upon request, usually in the event of a failure.

[OpenTelemetrys website](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a great resource to better understand STREAMING telemetry.

## FILE_BASED Telemetry

FILE_BASED telemetry is similar to STREAMING telemetry in that it can emit logs, metrics, and traces. However, the key difference lies in its ability to capture high-fidelity content, such as memory dumps, packet captures, or CPU samples.

Unlike STREAMING telemetry, which is continuously emitted, FILE_BASED telemetry is only uploaded when necessary, typically in the event of a failure.
