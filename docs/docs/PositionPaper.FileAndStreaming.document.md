# FILE vs. STREAMING Telemetry

## Introduction

DynamicTelemetry defines two types of telemetry - STREAMING, and FILE_BASED.

* STREAMING : typical Observability - intended for immediate egress, flowing into backend databases.
* FILE_BASED : telemetry that doesn't stream well, memory dumps, CPU samples, packet captures, or  FLIGHT_RECORDERS.

## STREAMING Telemetry:

OpenTelemetry is the recommend Observability API surface for DynamicTelemetry.  The gist of STREAMING telemetry is to take observations/logs and to upload to a network connected backend, as soon as possible.

STREAMING telemetry has three common subtypes {Logs, Metrics, and Traces} that share the common desire to egress the telemetry as soon as possible.

[OpenTelemetryâ€™s website](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a great resource to better understand STREAMING telemetry.
