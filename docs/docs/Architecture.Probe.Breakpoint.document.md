## Notes (Breakpoint Probe)

A breakpoint probe is a type of probe that utilizes a software or hardware breakpoint, depending on the programming language.

This is a riskier probe type because the instruction pointer will transfer into the underlying kernel facilities. However, it is not as risky as a traditional debugger, as the instruction pointer will not be frozen. Instead, it will simply collect the memory and exit using standard OpenTelemetry.

Some types of breakpoint probes may include.

1. [uProbe](./Architecture.Probe.uprobes.document.md)
1. dotnet
1. [pTrace](./Architecture.Probe.ptrace.document.md)
1. [dtrace](./Architecture.Probe.DTrace.document.md)
(etc)
